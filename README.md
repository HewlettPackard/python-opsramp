# python-opsramp
A Python language binding for the OpsRamp API

TravisCI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HewlettPackard/python-opsramp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HewlettPackard/python-opsramp)
CircleCI [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/HewlettPackard/python-opsramp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/HewlettPackard/python-opsramp)

## About
This directory tree contains a Python module that provides a convenient way to
access the OpsRamp REST API programmatically. The OpsRamp API documentation is
somewhat opaque and this binding hides some of the details for exactly that reason.
I have also added "assert" statements in various places to guard against pitfalls
that I ran into that are not obvious from the API docs.

### Scope
The basic framework of this library is in place and the
scope has increased incrementally over time. The supplied samples
exercise most of the main API sections and are described
later in this document.

Note however that all of our wrapper objects also provide an `api` property that
can be used to access REST URLs further down the API tree
where we have not written a specific wrapper class yet.

While you can use these api objects to work directly with OpsRamp at a REST level,
please consider taking the small amount of time needed to add a proper wrapper class
here instead, for your own benefit and that of future users.

### Return values
All functions in this binding return regular Python objects (not JSON strings).
In general you will need to look at the OpsRamp API docs to see exactly what
sort of object and/fields the response will contain; typically we return exactly
what the API gave us, or an equivalent Python object if it returned JSON.

### Runtime Environment
This module is primarily designed for use on Python 3.

We also run the unit tests against Python 2.7 and it *should* work correctly there
too. Note however that Python 2 went end-of-life in late 2019 and we reserve
the right to drop support for it in a future version of this module.

## Public Object Tree
Following is a summary of the object tree currently available in this OpsRamp language binding. See
the "Samples" section later in this document for an illustration of how to use them.

You start by calling `opsramp.binding.connect()`
which returns a single "OpsRamp" object to represent the entire REST API instance
that you want to access, and make a series of calls that return progressively lower level objects to access
lower level information from OpsRamp. For clarity in these end-user instructions I have omitted several Python
classes that are internal implementation detail in the module and not intended for direct use by external callers.

Here's an illustration of a simple use of the binding. See the Samples section for more detailed ones.
```
import opsramp.binding

ormp = opsramp.binding.connect(OPSRAMP_URL, KEY, SECRET)
cfg = ormp.config()
print('alert types', cfg.get_alert_types())
print('timezones', cfg.get_timezones())
```

### Class diagram
This diagram is an overview of the public classes and their relationship to each other.
The individual classes are described in detail in the following section. This diagram
was produced using [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) `apt-get install graphviz`
and to edit it you need to modify the
source file classes.dot and regenerate the PNG from that.

`dot -Tpng < classes.dot > classes.png`

![OpsRamp classes](classes.png)

I have used color to highlight the subset of classes that implement a "create" method.

### Class definitions

import opsramp.binding

- def connect(url, key, secret) _returns an instance of the class Opsramp that is connected to the specified API endpoint_
  This function posts a login request to the specified endpoint URL using the key and secret given. This post
  returns an access token, which the function uses to construct an Opsramp object and returns that.
- class Opsramp(url, token) _an object representing the complete API tree of one OpsRamp instance_
  - config() -> returns a GlobalConfig object that can be used to access global settings for this OpsRamp instance.
  - tenant(uuid) -> returns a Tenant object representing the API subtree for one specific tenant.
  - metrics() -> returns a MetricsApi object that can be used to access the raw metrics api of this OpsRamp instance.

import opsramp.globalconfig

- class GlobalConfig() _read-only access to global settings on this OpsRamp instance_
  - get\_alert\_types() -> returns a list of the global alert types that are defined on this OpsRamp instance.
  - get\_channels() -> returns a list of the "channels" that are defined on this OpsRamp instance. See the OpsRamp docs for details.
  - get\_countries() -> a list of dicts each describing one country known to this OpsRamp instance.
  - get\_timezones() -> a list of dicts each describing one timezone known to this OpsRamp instance.
  - get\_alert\_technologies() -> a list of dicts each describing one alert technology known to this OpsRamp instance.
  - get\_nocs() -> a list of dicts each describing one NOC known to this OpsRamp instance.

import opsramp.metrics

- class MetricsApi() _the metrics API subtree for this OpsRamp instance_
  - get(pattern) -> returns metric definitions or time series values, depending on the pattern.
  This a raw interface to the GET portions of the OpsRamp metrics API and you should consult the OpsRamp
  documentation for the syntax that is permitted in pattern.
  - search(pattern) -> returns metric _time series_ values matching the pattern. These patterns
  can be quite complex and you should refer to the OpsRamp API documentation for the syntax.

import opsramp.tenant

- class Tenant(uuid) _the API subtree for one specific tenant_
  - get\_alert\_script() -> Returns a string containing the appropriate Python script to run on a Linux node
  to install the OpsRamp agent there and connect it to this Tenant. This text contains the tenant's access keys
  so think twice before printing it to the screen or logs.
  - integrations() -> returns an Integrations object representing all integrations on this Tenant.
  - rba() -> returns an Rba object representing all runbook automation information for this Tenant.
  - monitoring() -> returns a Monitoring object representing all monitoring information for this Tenant.
  - policies() -> returns a Policies object representing the device management policies on this Tenant.
  - clients() ->  returns a Clients object representing all OpsRamp clients on this Tenant. _Note that
  this is only valid for MSP-level tenants because an OpsRamp client cannot contain other clients._

  - service\_maps() -> returns a ServiceMaps object. Service maps are used to create directed graphs of dependencies
  that are used in the OpsRamp UI to present human-readable graphs of the impact of service failures on each other.
  - kb() -> returns a KnowledgeBase object. These are used to organize
  knowledge base articles and categories related to this tenant.

  returns its uuid. Optionally takes the uuid of a pre-existing category under which to nest the new one.
  - category(uuid) -> returns a Category object representing the API subtree for one specific category.

  - get(uuid) -> returns the definition of one specific script as a Python dict.
  See the OpsRamp API docs for detailed contents of these dicts.
  - create(definition) -> creates a new *script* in this category. "definition" is a Python dict
  specifying details of the script to be created. The content of these structs is complex so helper
  functions for creating them are provided below.
  - @staticmethod mkParameter(name, description, datatype, optional=False, default=None) -> helper function that returns a
  Python dict describing one parameter of a proposed new script.

  a Python dict describing a proposed new script. There are lots of optional arguments because these structs
  have variable content depending on the type of script and also some are only applicable on Linux, some only on Windows.
  The function contains `assert` statements to flag violations of (some of) those rules.
  I may add another layer of helpers later that are more specificially targetted (like "mkPythonLinuxScript" for example)
  and implement those by calling mkScript() internally with appropriate arguments.
  - update(uuid, definition) -> Updates an existing *script* in this category given the uuid of the script.The Python dict, "definition" is similar to the one used for create call and the helper functions used for create can be used for update too.

import opsramp.msp

- class Clients() _the subtree containing all clients of this MSP-level tenant_
  An OpsRamp client cannot contain other clients so this is class is only useful with MSP-level tenants.
  - get() -> returns a list of dicts, each one containing minimal details for one client. It's worth
  noting that the main ID field in the objects that get returned is called *uniqueId* and this is the
  value you need to use everywhere in this binding that a client ID is required.
  - get(uuid) -> returns the definition of one specific client as a Python dict.
  See the OpsRamp API docs for detailed contents of these dicts.
  - search(self, pattern='') -> returns a list of client ids matching the specified search pattern, the format of
  which is described in the OpsRamp documentation.
  - create(definition) -> creates a new Client in this Tenant. "definition" is a Python dict
  specifying details of the client to be created.
  The content of these structs is complex so helper functions for creating them are provided below.

  - suspend(uuid) -> marks the client as "suspended" in OpsRamp. _This takes 10+ seconds to run._
  - terminate(uuid) -> terminates the client in OpsRamp. _The API docs say that this call deletes the client but in
  reality it just goes onto an "inactive" list that is retrievable through the API and visible in the UI. OpsRamp
  say that clients on the inactive list will get garbage collected eventually, but I couldn't get clarity on
  how long "eventually" is._
  - @staticmethod mkHours(day\_start=datetime.time(9, 0),
                day\_end=datetime.time(17, 0),
                week\_start=2, week\_end=6,
                sms\_voice\_notification=False) -> returns a dict that can be used to define
  customer working and opening hours in OpsRamp.

  - itypes() -> Returns a Types object describing all the *types*
  of integrations that are available to be installed on this Tenant. Each
  represents a *category* like CUSTOM, AZURE, rather than specific instances
  of those.
  - instances() -> Returns an Instances object representing all the actual
  instances of integrations that are installed on this Tenant.
  - _available() -> A synonym for "types()" that I included because that's
  the name of the API endpoint in OpsRamp that returns this set of data.
  It took a while to figure out what the returned data means though,
  so we went with the more obvious name "types" here instead._
  - _installed() -> A synonym for "instances()" that I included because that's

## Samples and examples
The `samples` subdirectory contains a series of short Python scripts illustrating
the use of most of the major API sections that we cover. These are supposed to be
self-explanatory so I will not document them in detail here. If any of the samples
are not obvious then please submit a PR that adds comments to the appropriate
source file explaining how it works, as an aid to other users.

All of the samples expect to be run as modules, like this:
```
ls -l samples/*.py
python3 -m samples.timezone_list
python3 -m samples.integration_list
python3 -m samples.category_list
python3 -m samples.client_list
... etc ...
```

### OpsRamp credentials
Each of the samples depends on the existence of some environment variables to tell it which OpsRamp
endpoint to use and the relevant creds. You can see those at the top of timezones.py
for example, and you must set them appropriately in your environment before running it.
```
export OPSRAMP_URL='https://my-org.api.try.opsramp.com'
export OPSRAMP_TENANT_ID='client_1234'
export OPSRAMP_KEY='whatever'
export OPSRAMP_SECRET='whatever'
```
The tenant id, key and secret are obtained from an "integration" in the OpsRamp UI.
You need to go to "setup", "integrations" and look for (or create) a row containing
a custom integration that uses OAUTH2. It doesn't matter what it's called, you just
need its id and creds to call the REST API.

On the list of integrations, click on the integration name in the appropriate row
and a screen appears with the "Tenant Id", "Key" and "Secret" fields that you need.
The UI even gives sample curl commands at the bottom and you can cut the URL value
out of those if it's not obvious. It's just the bit as far as opsramp.com like the
example above.

It's not obvious, but the creds you're getting here are for *the entire Tenant*
(aka client) and will be the same for all integrations on that Tenant. Be careful
with them, don't put them in logs or post them online by accident.

If there isn't a suitable integration already (or you want your own) then create a new
one by selecting the "other" tab in the Available Integrations section at the bottom
of the page and then "custom". Give it a name and leave the image file field blank.
The name will appear in access logs but otherwise has no real meaning. Select OAUTH2
as the authentication type and hit Save. This will bring you to the screen with keys
and curl commands etc as described above.

### examples.py
The file `examples.py` collects together a series of examples and illustrates most of
the major areas of the API that we cover. It uses the same environment variables as
the samples to tell it which OpsRamp tenant to examine.

`python3 -m opsramp.examples`

### Simple CLI prototype
I wrote a simple Python program that uses this binding to perform some simple
read-only operations on OpsRamp. Uses the same environment variables as above.
```
$ python3 -m opsramp.cli tenant rba categories | jq -S .
[
  {
    "id": 346,
    "name": "Day to day actions"
  },
  {
    "id": 698,
    "name": "DR procedures"
  }
]
$ python3 -m opsramp.cli tenant monitoring templates
538 monitoring templates found
$ python3 -m opsramp.cli tenant agent script | wc -l
763
$
```

## The API objects and direct REST calls
If we don't have a class that exposes the piece of the API that you want to use, then you can use the `ApiObject` base
class to make REST calls to that part directly while still using the correct wrapper classes for everything else.

The general approach would be to navigate to the nearest object for which we do have a wrapper and use its `api` property
to get an instance of the `ApiObject` class that you can then use to make direct REST calls to the tree below that point.
This still has an advantage over raw curl or "requests" calls because the enclosing object class will have set up the
URLs and access tokens for you.

### API object example
```
monitoring_api = ormp.tenant('client_9234').monitoring().api
result = monitoring_api.get('/templates')
print(result)
```
This uses a REST get() to retrieve the list of templates directly from OpsRamp, by starting from the api object
of a Monitoring object. The Monitoring object will have already done all the work to set up the correct tenant,
credentials and other context for that call so it's still much easier than making httplib, requests or curl
calls yourself.

- ApiObject() _an object representing some subtree of a REST API_
  - get(suffix='', headers={}) -> performs a GET to the specified REST endpoint and returns the body of the
  server's reply. "headers" is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers that you want to send
  with the GET.
  - post(suffix='', headers={}, data=None, json=None) -> performs a POST to the specified REST endpoint and
  returns the body of the server's reply. "headers" is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers
  that you want to send, "data" is the text body, or "json" is a Python struct to be converted to a JSON
  string and sent as a body. _Specifying both "data" and "json" in the same call results in undefined behavior
  and should be avoided._
  - put(suffix='', headers={}, data=None, json=None) -> performs a PUT to the specified REST endpoint and
  returns the body of the server's reply. "headers" is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers
  that you want to send, "data" is the text body, or "json" is a Python struct to be converted to a JSON
  string and sent as a body. _Specifying both "data" and "json" in the same call results in undefined behavior
  and should be avoided._
  - delete(suffix='', headers={}) -> performs a DELETE to the specified REST endpoint and returns the body of
  the server's reply. "headers" is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers that you want to send.
  - patch(suffix='', headers={}, data=None, json=None) -> performs a PATCH to the specified REST endpoint and
  returns the body of the server's reply. "headers" is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers
  that you want to send, "data" is the text body, or "json" is a Python struct to be converted to a JSON
  string and sent as a body. _Specifying both "data" and "json" in the same call results in undefined behavior
  and should be avoided._
  - _we will add other http actions if/when a specific need for them arises_
